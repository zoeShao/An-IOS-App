Through the launch of our new program, YouthOrganize, we hope to connect with youth 29 and under who are creating community spaces where they live.
Sometimes it can be hard to know where to start, or how to make your group or program the best it can be! We are launching a new online space to connect 2SLGBTQ youth leaders across Ontario with each other, and with experienced community builders who are excited to share their knowledge and experience with young people doing the work.","https://gallery.mailchimp.com/06a326d6905df1ad487d722f3/images/2708432d-d2a4-4c12-9256-d1cc2b111acf.png"
