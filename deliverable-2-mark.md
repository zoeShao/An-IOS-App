Product
- App makes clear initial steps towards an MVP which solves the problem at hand.
- Perhaps this is an upcoming feature but the events may benefit from a calendar style presentation since time is an important factor for events.
  - Not clear how the events under "My Events" in the profile lead to the Events tab.

README.md
- Description is concise yet given good background info for the motivation for this project. Consider adding a sentence or two about the partner/app content for context. 

plan.md
- Within Process Artifacts, task priority is based on "level of importance" which is essentially a definition for priority. How would a new member to the team decide whether to rank one task over another? Be more specific to the application.
  - Could be more clarity on how tasks are assigned as well.
- Great breakdown of Goals and the tasks that lead to them. Good way of thinking about this section. 

review.md
- Sounds like backend could use less people and front end could use more. Why are there no plans to redistribute the team members?
- Why did the login page not get completed? 
- Meeting highlights are too concrete here. Think more broadly about the key ideas to keep in mind to guide your next sprint.
