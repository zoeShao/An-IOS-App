Product
- Meets expectations 

README.md
- Very thorough

plan.md
- The changes must be process related (not product, as the team has it currently described). The team must identify any process changes or successes and explain them

review.md
-  Very light on details and justifications - the team is expected to list any process success, failures and changes and provide a clear explanation for each. 
-  Multiple parts of the existing template remain.
