## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 9, 2019
 * Where: BA 3175

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 * we choose to draw flow chart before coding. Flow chart help us to see
 each pages relation more clearly.
 * assign work in detail to each group member. This improve our work efficiency a lot, each member have clear idea what they 
   need to do


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 * we planed to have three group members to do front-end. However, fornt-end have heavy work load in this deliverables.   
 * back-end group members had little work to do.



#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
 * we change our group structure, before changing, we have three members in back-end group and three members in front-end        group. After changing, we have four members in front-end group. Since there is lot of work need to be done in front-end.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 * iOS front-end app which has basically finished layout (working buttoms and navigation inside app) with some hard-coded        local data for demo.
 * data structure for back-end is confirmed

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
 * iOS App do not deploy yet. We under-estimate difficulty to deploy iOS App, we do not have enough to deploy it.
## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
 In the next iteration, we need to finish back-end part of our App, combineing front-end and back-end of our product,
