#### Team Rules

#### Team culture:
Our team’s culture is data-driven, every group member can propose a different solution which supported by a reasonable explanation. Every ideas should have proper reasoning. More importantly, our working environment is friendly and open-minded for any possible solution. We believe that effective communication is the key to build a outstanding team.

#### Team communication:
Channels of communication: WeChat (former channel, now used for casual talks), Slack (currently using for any update in the team)

Our team communication could be done in two ways, via online chatting apps or having a group meeting. All of our team members keep a close contact with each other every day using online chatting, in order to keep every member updated by the latest news and arrangements.

To cooperate with our partner, we use slack and email to keep them updated. Email will be sent on a weekly basis, while other communications will be on Slack. If we cannot reach the partners by slack, we will try to call them or email them. Additionally, considering online chatting could be very inefficient when long discussion is needed for making essential decisions, we keep having a group meeting on weekly basis. 

#### Team meeting:

At the beginning of the semester, every member in our group has updated his/her course schedule onto a sharable doc. By combining everyone’s schedule, we have a clear timetable indicating all possible meeting time for our team. Before the coming of every new week, Yuting in our team will be responsible for making arrangements of our next meeting time, location and attendances. Members who might not be presented will be asked to provide his/her ideas and reasoning about the topic beforehand, or to accept a phone call at meeting time when he/she is physically absent. 

The same mechanics works for our meeting with the partner. Based on our schedule, we send email to confirm a meeting with our partner, with number of team members who will be going. Members might take shifts for each other when someone is busy, but we’re trying to keep every member involved in meeting with the partner.

#### Conflict resolution: 
* Indecision: We vote for decision and go for the one with majority votes.
* Non-responsive team members: Try to set up a face-to-face meeting with them and try to find out/fix any problem with them.
* Not-doing-work: Friendly alarm him and discuss the potential issues.


#### Events
As it has been mentioned before, we’re having pre-arranged meetings in person on a weekly basis, to discuss about the latest updates of the course, share ideas within the team, check everyone’s progress and give out new tasks. The meeting usually takes place in Bahen Center, 40 St. George Street. In our next meeting after the submission of deliverable 1, we’re planning to have a meeting about the functionalities and product prototype.

Also, we do have online meetings via either voice chatting or texting in a group. This could happen at any time of a day and solves little issues within the team. 

#### Artifacts

Artifacts that we have in our team construct:
* A schedule containing all available time slots for the team
* A team log that contains all our meeting details and records
* A sharable doc where we post the latest to-do list for the team
* A chatting group on WeChat and Slack

    
We keep every of our team member acknowledged about our current tasks, by sending group notices on WeChat and updating our to-do list in a sharable doc. Everyone in our team can either go to the online doc to see what should be done or check the group messages every day. The priority of every task is decided mostly in our group meetings, based on the level of importance. To ensure that every member is assigned with reasonable work, we split our group into two divisions (frontend and backend). Furthermore, we usually discuss about distribution of jobs right after our group tasks are decided. By selecting one member to be our product manager, we also have someone to keep track of everyone’s progress, so that everyone is ensured to know what he/she is doing at a certain time spot.


#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.
##### Goals:
 * The main goal for thie iteration is: Having a deployable front-end app which has basically finished layout with some hard-coded data for demo.
 * The secondary goal is: 
##### To achieve the Main Goal, following tasks is required:
 * Coming up with a working flow that everyone can share the same code base and have comfortable experience to commit their code to the team repo.
 * Getting familiar with the developing environment of XCode, learn how to create views or controller of user interface. Experiment the iOS App develop flow. 
 * 

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
