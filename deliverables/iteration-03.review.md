# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration XX

 * Start date: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU HAD YOUR FIRST TEAM PLANNING MEETING
 * End date: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ARE PLANNING TO HAVE YOUR REVIEW MEETING

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction

#### Changes from previous iteration

List the most significant changes you made to your process (if any).

 * At most 3 items
 * Start with the most significant change
 * For each change, explain why you are making it and what you are hoping to achieve from it
 * Ideally, for each change, you will define a clear success metric (i.e. something you can measure at the end of the iteration to determine whether the change you made was successful)

 > *Note:* If you are not making any changes to your process, it means that you are happy with all of the decisions you made in the previous iterations.
 > In this case, list what you consider to be the most significant process decisions your team made. For each decision, explain why you consider it successful, and what success metric you are using (or could use) to assert that the decision is successful.
 
 #### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role. 
 * Roles should reflect the structure of your team and be appropriate for your project. Not necessarily one role to one team member.

List each team member and:
 * A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
 * 3 technical strengths and weaknesses each (e.g. languages, frameworks, libraries, development methodologies, etc.)

#### Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

Communications:
 * What is the expected frequency? What methods/channels are appropriate? 
 * If you have a partner project, what is your process (in detail) for communicating with your partner?
 
Meetings:
 * How are people held accountable for attending meetings, completing action items? Is there a moderator or process?
 
Conflict Resolution:
 * List at least three team scenarios/conflicts you discussed in lecture and how you decided you will resolve them. Indecisions? Non-responsive team members? Any other scenarios you can think of?


#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the **purpose** of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!



## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
