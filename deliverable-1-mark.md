## Feedback
Product
- Q1 is answered well. Immediately obvious what is being built, then some next level details, as well as why this is a problem to be solved.
- This app is highly centered around the users. I feel that more could be said about the users here. Why under 29? Are there example organizations? Government organizations, NFP, etc?
- Lots of good ideas came out of the collab process. Well explained. 

Plan
- Team roles and responsibilities are well laid out and easy to understand.
- Good user stories. Demonstrates a number of problems that will be addressed by the app.
- Product artifacts could be clarified. 

Overall Quality
- Makes good use of formatting which benefits understandability.
